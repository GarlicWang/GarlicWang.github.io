Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work with [Prof. Olgica Milenkovic](https://publish.illinois.edu/milenkovic/).
My research interests primarily focus on generative modeling for drug design and time series data.

Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University.
I was a research assistant advised by [Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/index.html), focusing on uncertainty estimation in large language models.

<!-- Prior to this, I worked with [Prof. Chaun-Ju Wang](http://cfda.csie.org/) and [Prof. Che Lin](https://www.idssp.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) focusing on knowledge graph completion and heterogeneous graph neural networks. I have also spent time at the CMoney AI team developing explainable recommendation systems. -->

<!-- In addition to research, I am deeply fascinated by entrepreneurship. During my junior year, I was privileged to participate in the [NTU Creativity and Entrepreneurship Program](https://cep.ntu.edu.tw/), which ignited a profound inspiration within me. As part of my journey, I also attended the prestigious [Stanford ASES Summit](https://ases.stanford.edu/) in April 2023 where I met aspiring student entrepreneurs from around the world and Stanford University. -->
