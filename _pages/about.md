Hi! Iâ€™m an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. I am currently a visiting undergrad research assistant in [UCLA CML Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/chohsieh-research/home), advised by [Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/index.html). I am also an undergrad research assistant in [NTU iDSSP Lab](https://www.idssp.ee.ntu.edu.tw/), advised by Prof. Che Lin. My research interest broadly covers Recommendation Systems, Graph Neural Networks, and Large Language Models.

In addition to research, I am deeply fascinated by entrepreneurship. During my junior year, I was privileged to participate in the [NTU Creativity and Entrepreneurship Program](https://cep.ntu.edu.tw/), which ignited a profound inspiration within me. As part of my journey, I also attended the prestigious [Stanford ASES Summit](https://ases.stanford.edu/) in April 2023 where I met aspiring entrepreneur students from around the world and Stanford University.
