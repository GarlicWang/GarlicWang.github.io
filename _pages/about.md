Hi! Iâ€™m an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. My research interest mainly covers the trustworthiness and interpretability of graph neural networks (GNN) and large language models (LLMs). Currently, I am a research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/index.html), focusing on uncertainty estimation in large language models. Prior to this, I worked with [Prof. Chaun-Ju Wang](http://cfda.csie.org/) and [Prof. Che Lin](https://www.idssp.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) focusing on knowledge graph completion and heterogeneous graph neural networks. I have also spent time at the CMoney AI team developing explainable recommendation systems.

In addition to research, I am deeply fascinated by entrepreneurship. During my junior year, I was privileged to participate in the [NTU Creativity and Entrepreneurship Program](https://cep.ntu.edu.tw/), which ignited a profound inspiration within me. As part of my journey, I also attended the prestigious [Stanford ASES Summit](https://ases.stanford.edu/) in April 2023 where I met aspiring student entrepreneurs from around the world and Stanford University.
